            Around this point into the relationship, I understand that it's expected that both families should come
            together
            to get to know each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            For obvious reasons this is a little more difficult for me. But I would still like for you to get to know me
            and
            my family better, and I thought it would be good to write a letter where I write about my background, my
            experiences growing up, and in the process giving a glimpse into the Malaysian culture and lifestyle that
            you
            may not know about.

        <h2 id="growing-up">Growing up</h2>
        <h3>Diaper days</h3>
        <p>
            I was born on a cold mid-November evening in 1995, the first child of a high school math teacher and a
            finance consultant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after I was born, my father had himself involved with a global merger project, and so my earliest
            years were spent mostly abroad across Jakarta, Bangkok, and Singapore.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our main abode during those years were mostly hotels. Back then, my father was burying himself in work,
            while my mother stayed at home to care for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't remember much from those days, but my parents would often say that I was playful, restless, but also
            curious. Taking me grocery shopping was apparently a nightmare as I would constantly try to grab stuff
            whilst strapped to the pram, and I would often break toys apart just to figure out how they worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn't until I turned five, and around the time that my younger brother came along, that we finally
            returned to Malaysia. My parents bought a modest terrace house in a mid-sized town called <i>Taman Tun
            ('Tun' Park)</i>.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <span class="marginnote">The map shows the borders of Kuala Lumpur. Notice that <em>Taman Tun</em> sits at the edge of the city.</span>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dsTcNx8.png" alt="TTDI" style="width: 200px; height: auto;">
        </figure>

        <p>
            <i>Taman Tun</i> was not too dissimilar from Bundang - a township that although fairly removed from the
            heart of the capital, was populous, developed and self-sufficient.
        </p>

        <p>
            Terrace houses made up most of the residential neighbourhood; not because there was plenty of space to go
            around, but because people in Malaysia generally didn't like owning apartments - the notion of not owning
            the land under your feet, of having to pay service fees, of being subservient to property managers, was
            off-putting for many.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <span class="marginnote">Bird's eye view over <em>Taman Tun</em>. Notice the flat terrain and sparsity of the neighbourhood.</span>
            <img src="https://content.r9cdn.net/rimg/dimg/bd/13/d2df7581-city-23450-164f69dd96c.jpg">
        </figure>

        <p>
            This played a big part in Malaysian lifestyle, as people who owned houses often exercised this freedom to
            truly make it their home, large renovations was almost always done before moving in. You will find that no
            two houses on the same street ever looked the same.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <span class="marginnote">The second house from the left was the house that I grew up in.</span>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/D3Dp1RZ.png">
        </figure>

        <p>
            And so this was the place that I grew up and called home for much of my life, and is where my family still
            lives to this day.
        </p>

        <h3 id="childhood">Childhood</h3>

        <p>
            I think 'lonely' would be an accurate word to describe my childhood. My father worked long hours. By the
            time he was home I was usually already asleep, and by the time I was awake he would have already left for
            work. I only saw him a handful of times in a week.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for my mother... Malaysian schools typically run two sessions: morning sessions which run from 8am to
            3pm, and afternoon sessions which run from 12pm to 7pm. She taught classes from both sessions. Since the
            school she was teaching from was a distance away, it often wasn't until night time that she would arrive
            home. So whilst I saw her daily, she would usually be too tired to spend much time with us.
        </p>

        <p>
            And so much of my early childhood was in the presence of my grandparents. My parents would also later hire
            an Indonesian caretaker to help around the house. She would walk me to school, help me with homework, and
            ended up teaching me a lot whilst I was growing up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once my brother learned to speak, we started spending most of our free time playing together. Since we
            didn't have much toys, we had to be somewhat creative with what we had: we made various crafts from
            cardboard and paper, came up with games that we could play with nothing more than a pen and a sheet of
            paper; medieval fantasy was our favourite fictional genre to role-play.
        </p>

        <p>
            Financially I don't think my family struggled back then - neither my brother nor I had to work a day during
            our childhood - but it was somewhat clear then we had just enough to be comfortable and not much else. We
            seldom went on holidays; when we did, it was certainly only going to be a few hours away. We rarely ate out.
            Things like stationery, school uniforms, and shoes we had to stretch how long they lasted.
        </p>

        <p>
            It didn't bother me then, and it doesn't bother me now. But being brought up that way has instilled me with
            the importance of spending, and learning how to be content with less.
        </p>

        <h3 id="school-days">School days</h3>

        <p>
            The schooling system in Malaysia is rather complicated, because of its multi-cultural population, but also
            because it's undergone many reformations throughout the colonisation era. It's a topic I'd love to speak at
            length about, because it's a good exemplification of the scars and struggles that Malaysia has faced for
            centuries as a multi-ethnic nation who has yet to achieve cultural unity.
        </p>

        <p>
            One aspect of this is the existence of <em>vernacular schools</em>. These are schools where the national
            language, Malay, <em>is not</em> the language used in teaching. This type of schooling was established
            shortly after independence, spearheaded by wealthy Chinese settlers who at the time wanted their children to
            maintain a strong connection to their language and culture. As a result, today we have Chinese, Tamil, and
            English vernacular schools.
        </p>

        <p>
            I went to such a school - a Chinese vernacular school.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ethnic cultures play a big role in shaping the school curiculum. Activities like caligraphy, Chinese poem
            recitations, and celebrating Chinese festivals were a core part of the school syllabus and programme.
        </p>

        <p>
            As one might expect, most students who attended the school were ethnically Chinese, whose ancestors usually
            emigrated from southern China, and often spoke at home one other Chinese dialect other than Mandarin, like
            Hokkien, Hakka, or Cantonese. This is how I came to speak some of these languages.
        </p>

        <p>
            I would describe myself as timid during those days. I wasn't any teacher's favourite since I often skipped
            doing homework, but I'd like to think that I was a kid with a good heart who stayed out of most trouble. I
            had natural aptitude and so excelled in math and the sciences, was subpar in languages, and did poorly for
            everything that relied on rote memorisation.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember the schooling experience to be particularly tiring; having to wake up at 6 in the morning, and
            although classes finished late into the afternoon, I usually had multiple after-school tuition classes
            running late into the evening. Putting aside time for homework meant that there was very little time for
            anything else back then.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that's how I was from primary school all the way through to college. Although my grades in school got
            noticeably better as I progressed through the education ladder, as I was able to drop my weaker subjects in
            favour of specialising in the ones that I was already good at.
        </p>

        <h3 id="university-days">University days</h3>

        <p>
            I left Malaysia for Southampton in 2014 to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering. It was the first time
            I would be moving abroad living outside of Asia. Life in the UK for these first few years was certainly
            difficult and fraught with many struggles, but everyone I knew at the time was going through the same. By
            the skin of my teeth I finished with a First Class Honours in 2017. I wasn't able to secure myself a job in
            the UK, and so I returned home a month after graduating.
        </p>

        <p>
            When it came to looking for a job, I knew that I wanted to work with software. Back in university, I
            developed an appreciation for robotics and programming, and did quite well in those subjects; and yet, I
            still struggled to find an employer who would take me in for such a position. Not having done a formal
            education in computing meant that I lacked the fundamental knowledge required to do well in interviews.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I took a year off for self-study. I collated first-year course material across universities and took
            myself to the books. Despite making a lot of progress at this point, I did think that self-teaching was
            going to be an arduous process that I wasn't sure if I'd be able to see through on my own. With the blessing
            of my parents, I was able to pursue a masters degree in Computer Science in the next academic year.
        </p>

        <h2 id="the-family">The family, present day</h2>
        <p>
            At the time of writing this, my family still resides in Malaysia, living in the same neighbourhood that I
            grew up in.
        </p>
        <p>
            My parents have both retired roughly at the same time about 10 years ago. Together they have been enjoying a
            simple retirement life, taking pleasures in the smaller things: gardening, home improvement projects,
            enjoying local eateries.
        </p>
        <p>
            My father has picked up trail-running since his retirement, and now trains for ultra marathons which he does
            twice a year - he recently ran a 106km marathon at Kota Kinabalu! My mother on the other hand enjoys a
            sedentary lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother, 25, is currently in university studying Psychology at university in Malaysia. My sister, 18,
            will be finishing her A-levels this year; she hasn't decided what she will be pursuing for university yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of my grandparents are no longer with us. Only my grandmother from my mother's side of the family is
            around; she lives in the same house as my parents and siblings.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="the-relationship">The Relationship</h2>
        <h3 id="how-it-started">How it started</h3>

        <p>
            It was the first day of the computer science degree and I remember feeling quite anxious. After all, it was
            going to be a year-long commitment, I wanted to make sure it started off on a good foot, and that means
            making friends early.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hyewon and I met by the couches just outside the campus cafeteria, where I had been sitting with a few
            classmates I’d met only hours earlier. By the time we introduced ourselves to each other, she seemed as if
            she already knew everyone in the class. She invited me to a birthday party she was throwing for herself and
            mentioned that 20 classmates would be there. <em>Wow</em>, I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then she told me she studied law at Oxford. <em>What is she doing here?!</em> I thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            That moment cemented my impression of Hyewon for a long time: she was hard-working, outgoing, friendly, and
            incredibly smart. We ended up sharing a close-knit friend group that did group projects together, had dinner
            parties every week, and spent time hanging out between classes every day; and after much time together, I
            also came to realise how genuinely kind and sweet she was.
        </p>

        <h3 id="how-its-going">How it's going</h3>
        <p>
            It has now been 5 years since we both graduated. I started my first job at Macquarie almost immediately
            after submitting my thesis, and have been there ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I’ve been with the company for quite some time, I have transitioned through multiple roles and
            teams, which has kept my career fresh and exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I work on building the systems that analysts from offices around the world use to test their
            investment strategies, driving a significant percentage of the company revenue. I find the work rewarding,
            and I truly enjoy what I do.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the relationship, I think <em>comfortable</em> is what I would call it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the relationship has fallen into a bit of a routine over the years, I would describe it as more of
            a comfortable rhythm. We both have come to know what to expect from each other, but there's still a sense of
            excitement in the way we connect, and the conversations never lose their spark. Even after all this time, we
            find joy in chatting about anything and everything, with the same energy and curiosity as when we first met.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've weathered many tough moments together and have learned to appreciate how dependable we are for each
            other. Whether it's work stress or personal struggles, we've learned to lean on each other, and to offer
            unconditional support; it's the unspoken promise to always be there for each other that makes the
            relationship feel so secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also spend a lot of time talking about what the future could look like. Whether it's over dinner, or
            during late-night walks, we often dream about where we live, the career choices we want to make, and the
            adventures we want to experience. Hyewon has always been the bigger dreamer between us, with goals often
            grander than mine. This enthusiasm of hers has reallt rubbed off on me, and has pushed me to think bigger
            for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I can't help but feel the same excitement whenever I see how passionate she is. It makes me want to help
            her make it happen, to do whatever I can to make them real.
        </p>

        <h3 id="where-its-going">Where it's going</h3>

        <p>
            So far, Hyewon and I have had an incredibly fulfilling relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not a day has gone by where we have felt exhausted of each other. Every day truly feels like a new
            experience. Even after 6 years we find that there's still so much to learn about each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're both optimistic about the future, knowing the best is likely still ahead of us, and are excited to
            face it hand-in-hand.
